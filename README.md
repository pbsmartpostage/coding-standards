# Front End Coding Standards

These rules and standards are a good start at keeping a good, clean code base, allowing us to collaborate easier with each other, and follow one another's code.

Everything you read here, is a combination of guildlines from several well respected contributors.

There is a list of rules to try to follow, along with some more detailed guidelines for each aspect of the front end.

Enjoy...

> Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.

## Rules

These are our rules we should live by.

### Rule 1: Please Obey the Rules
Where possible, the rules must be followed to the letter. These rules are always open for discussion, and review, and there might be times where a rule needs to be broken. A good explination for the reasoning behind this should be delivered to the team, if at all possible.

### Rule 2: Lead by Example
Always follow the rules in your own code. Do not break the rules intentionally, as this causes more work for everyone as they clean up your code.

### Rule 3: Help Others
Help others follow the rules. If you see someone breaking the rules, guide them to follow the rules. This needs to be done in a nice way, as we are all on the same team.

### Rule 4: Spaces Rule the Roost
Always use spaces, never tabs in your code. If you are using an editor or IDE that uses tabs, please change it to use spaces. This is the default for Visual Studio, and helps the spacing between editors.

### Rule 5: Remember to Keep it DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself. Do not copy and paste blocks of code from one file to the next. Break things into reusable modules. Squashing the same bug in several different files is timesome.

### Rule 6: Stay current
Keep yourself up to date on new technologies. A good rule of thumb as to what you should know, is ```n+1``` libraries. There is always something newer, better and more simple.

### Rule 7: Contribute
The rules are not here to be written by one and followed by all, they are written by the team for the team. So contribute your ideas and best practices! See [How to Contribute](/contributing).
